# React Learning Projects

*This repository is dedicated to tracking and testing my learning progress in **React.***

It contains various mini-projects and practice files based on core React concepts, including:

- React Hooks (e.g., `useState`, `useEffect`, etc.)
- Component design and structure
- Event handling
- State management
- Other essential React features

 **Note:** You may find comments like `//...` in several files. These are added purely for **my personal reference and convenience** â€” they are *not* copied from ChatGPT or any external resources.

## Purpose
